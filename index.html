      <p>
        I was born in Cuba on the 7th July 1988, and since I was a little girl I felt very inclined towards Arts. I did some ballet, and got some piano lessons, where I discovered my passion about music, and when I was 9 years old I entered the music conservatory “Alejandro Garcia Caturla” where I studied classical guitar and piano throughout my primary and high school years. It has been one of the most wonderful experiences of my life!
  It was during my last high school year when computers made an appearance on Cuban schools and I immediately felt in love with technology! It was a scary thing but I wanted to jump right into it. So, instead of pursuing a career in Music, I went to study Computer Technician, and after 4 years I started an apprenticeship as a Web Master. Unfortunately, because of my background on Music I wasn’t taken very seriously and was persuaded I wasn’t good enough for Science, so I abandoned my internship and became a tour guide instead.

        It was a journey I enjoyed very much. It gave me the chance to travel around my country, talking about our history, culture and traditions and meeting people from all over the world, altought there was always this nostalgic feeling in my heart that longered to go back to Science. This journey came to an end in 2016 when I moved to Scotland with my 2 children to finally reunite with my husband.
  I’ve been working in several fields, doing some tour guiding, whisky guiding, hotel reception and now being a carer and bartender. But I still have this desire to be a web and software developer and I feel ready to go for it! 
  So here I am, diving head first into my dreams and looking into the future with excitement and hope!
